# dod-playground

Sample OOP/ECS/DOD project (C++) for an internal Unity lecture in 2018, aimed at junior/future engineers.
----------------------------_________________________________________-------------------------------------------------------
This is a super-simple C++ "game" _(just a bunch of sprites moving around with very small amount of logic really)_ I made to
show how one might go from a very traditional OOP style GameObject/Component based code to an ECS _(Entity Component System)_ /
DOD _(Data Oriented Design)_ based code. In the process making it run 10x faster, initialize 5x faster, and saving 100MB of memory
in the process.
